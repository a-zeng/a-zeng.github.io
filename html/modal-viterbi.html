    <hr>

    <p> One long day during the summer of 2022 in Northeastern's machine shop, small talk of hobbies arose out of sheer boredom. The MIE machine shop is bustling during the fall and spring semesters due to capstone, but the humid Boston summers and damp underground shop stifles brain activity. Not like there's much to do during summers, anyways. </p>

    <p> Now, I've known the machinists for quite a while now and have gotten pretty close. Yet, some things never enter conversation, often because they're not relevant until it's mentioned. And I've yet to mention the hobby of mechanical keyboards even though I find them cool, namely because I'm ashamed by how much I've spent on the "hobby" (more like addiction). So, naturally, I tell them about this silly little keyboard that I've been working on, and surprise surprise, they want to see it. </p>

    <p>So I bring it in the next day.</p>

    <p>They lift it up, rotate it around to inspect it. "Oh, we can do better than this, we can machine one," they say.</p>

    <p>"Oooh, that'd be a cool project," I say. "It'll take some time to adapt the CAD to separate the top, since we can use a PCB instead to hold the switches."</p>

    <p>"But we can like... machine it all."</p>

    <p>"Why? Wouldn't that take a huge chunk of aluminum and not be practical?"</p>

    <p>"So?"</p>

    <p class="text-secondary">And that's the day that I learned boredom creates the most needlessly cool, impractically complex projects.</p>

    <p>And to fans of mechanical keyboards, I know this isn't practical. But cool doesn't care about your feelings.</p>

<h2>Act I. Work Keyboard</h2>
<div class="3dp-keeb">
    <p>For context, when I got my second co-op, I decided that I wanted to have an extremely quiet mechanical keyboard for work. Bonus points the more ergonomic it is, since I would be working at my desk a lot. I ended up choosing the Viterbi PCB, which is an ortholinear (keys are in a grid as opposed to staggered like normal keyboards), split (as implies, split down the middle), 60% (doesn't have specific function keys or numpad) keyboard. However, this PCB only comes with all the electronics, still requiring a case to be fabricated.</p>

    <p>Over about 3 days, I designed a custom case intended to fit the PCBs of the keyboard, with the neat feature of being seamless once both halves are put together in case I want to merge them. Oh, the bottom's also 3D printed using translucent filament, so the LEDs on the bottom of the PCB shine through and give a nice backlight. </p>
