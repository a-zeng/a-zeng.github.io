    I've always wanted to build my own marimba from raw materials due to being significantly cheaper than purchasing a new instrument. However, I have limited access to tools at my house, so while such an idea is not impossible, it is costly once tool purchasing costs are considered. One day, while browsing a used percussion equipment group, I found a listing for used marimba bars for $800. For context, the cheapest 4.3 octave marimba costs around $2500, with most of the cost coming from the skilled labor required for accurate tuning of marimba bars. I thought this was a great deal and perfect way to get a practice instrument, so I bought the bars and started working.
