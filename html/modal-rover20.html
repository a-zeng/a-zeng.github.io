<p>The Northeastern Mars Rover Team (NUROVER) was founded in September 2018, originally with the intention of competing in the following year's Mars Society University Rover Challenge (URC). The challenge requires the rover to partake in tasks emulating Mars' desert-like terrain, such as manipulating tools, interacting with objects, and autonomously navigating rocky terrain, all under a $18,000 budget and 50kg weight limit. More information can be found at the Mars Society's website <a href="http://urc.marssociety.org/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p>In the past three years that the team has competed, we've been accepted for field competition all years, achieving our highest Systems Acceptance Review (SAR) score in 2021. Our website can be found <a href="https://www.northeasternrover.com/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

    <p>I joined NUROVER in the 2020 season as part of the mobility team. This year, the mobility system was comprised of a 6-wheel drive rocker-bogie system. The rocker-bogie system is connected via a bar differential, which ensures that the rover can maintain at least 3 wheels on the ground even when traversing large obstacles. Compared to the previous year, the bar differential is a massive improvement since our implementation of a gear differential had significant backlash issues, rendering the rocker-bogie system significantly less effective. Each wheel is individually powered by a high-torque motor, allowing our rover to scale hilly terrain and slopes of over 45 degrees.</p>

    <p>As one of the mobility team leads for the 2021 competition year, my task was to oversee the design and manufacture of the frame of the rover, consisting of both the chassis and the mobility system. However, due to restrictions from COVID-19, the mobility team had limited to no access to university manufacturing or work spaces. Thus, our plans shifted to focus on testing the rover whenever possible and projects that do not require lab space, for example, fabricating 3D printed wheels.</p>

    <p>These 3D printed wheels are printed from 95A hardness TPU, which when combined with the honeycomb interior pattern, allow the wheel to be compliant, lightweight, and air-less. After much research into the tread pattern and creating multiple tread prototypes, we opted to go for a design similar to NASA's Curiosity rover. Additionally, using SolidWorks FEA, the maximum Von Mises stress that the wheel endures is less than 0.3 MPA, which is far below the 12 MPA tensile yield strength of the material.</p>
