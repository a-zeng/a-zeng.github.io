<p>The Northeastern Mars Rover Team (NUROVER) was founded in September 2018, originally with the intention of competing in the following year's Mars Society University Rover Challenge (URC). The challenge requires the rover to partake in tasks emulating Mars' desert-like terrain, such as manipulating tools, interacting with objects, and autonomously navigating rocky terrain, all under a $18,000 budget and 50kg weight limit. More information can be found at the Mars Society's website <a href="http://urc.marssociety.org/" target="_blank">here.</a>

    <p>Taking on a role as the arm lead for this year (as well as co-leading the mechanical team), my goal was ambitious: spearhead the development of a <b>custom robotic arm</b> within a <b>8 month period</b> capable of <b>moving dextrously around its workspace (on top of the rover!) and manipulating heavy objects.</b> </p>
