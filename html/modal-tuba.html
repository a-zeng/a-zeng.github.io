    After growing discontent with using the old, weathered tuba lent from my high school, I began to ponder about tubas and their accessibility. The cheap beginner tubas can cost over $1500, so it's not feasible to ask a new tuba player to  purchase an instrument that they will outgrow should they choose to continue playing. It would be amazing to have a cheap, beginner tuba...
</p>
<p>
    That's when I thought of combining 3D printing, a technology just entering the consumer space at the time that I was interested in, with other accessible parts to construct a tuba that would be cheap enough for a beginner player to use until they decide whether tuba is for them.
