<p>The Marble Machine X (MMX) has been crazy musician Martin Molin's dream for the past 4 years, and I've been following along his journey on YouTube since the release of his first Marble Machine back in 2016. These kinetic machines use dropped marbles to strike various instruments and play music. When he announced in June 2020 that he was looking for CAD help from the community, I instantly jumped in and I haven't regretted it one bit.</p>

<p><b>A render of the Marble Paths Pre-assembly (the assembly I am team leader of)</b></p>

<p>The MMX is modeled in Fusion 360, originally incorporating every bolt, screw, and nut that would be used in its mechanical construction. This, however, is resource-intensive and taxing for Fusion 360 to run, so the CAD team's main goal has been to defeature the assembly by removing unnecessary parts and simplifying modeled features. This process is intended to lose data on the parts, since the main priority of this first phase is to reduce loading times for the master assembly.</p>
