        I met one of my best friends in college over video games, specifically Apex Legends. Over COVID, we played hours of Apex and bonded over it. The Flatline rifle was always his favorite gun in the game, specifically its Reactive skin. For his birthday, I wanted to do something special for him, and I thought it would be so cool to create a firing version of the Flatline Reactive skin.

<h2>Modelling the Blaster</h2>
<p>The toughest part of modelling the blaster was converting the game-optimized geometry to (partially) solid bodies. This step of converting a graphics body to a solid body EASILY took a majority of the project's time. When you import a game asset into Solidworks, it's usually optimized for efficiency when rendering in the game, so many faces are decimated and interpolated instead of smooth. I constantly found myself segmenting the mesh to add in edges, then working with surfaces to split the model into discrete chunks. By the end, I had a product that could work as the baseline which I work the blaster into. The middle section of the blaster is not modelled to save time, as it's not needed because the Nerf blaster will fit between the two segments</p>

    <p><b>Mesh Bodies of the Blaster's Structure</b></p>
</div>

<p>From here, the mesh bodies need to be segmented nicely so that they can all fit on the build plate of the 3D printer and easily fit together during assembly. I opted to try to model most of the blaster without COTS fasteners or adhesives, and only use self-tapping screws where strength is required and hot glue where there is no space for a fastener.</p>

<p>Of the parts in the front of the blaster, I'm the most proud of the design for the cover plates. These are meant to add splashes of color to the blaster, and I wanted them to be printable separately instead of multi-color to make the design more accessible and less wasteful. Due to these restraints, I came up with a clever idea of combining snap fit geometry with posts to securely lock the plates in place. This took a few iterations to optimize the feel of the press fit, as well as tabs on the side.</p>
